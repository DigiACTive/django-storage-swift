# django-storage-swift: a storage layer for OpenStack Swift

django-storage-swift allows Django applications to use OpenStack Swift as a file storage layer.

**As this is a fork, our development occurs in topic branches and is collected in the [digiactive branch](https://github.com/DigiACTive/django-storage-swift/tree/digiactive). Go there to access the documentation and features we've added.**
